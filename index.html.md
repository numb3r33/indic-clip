# Indic-CLIP


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This file serves as the README and the index for the project
documentation.

## Project Goal

This project aims to adapt the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training) architecture for Indic languages, specifically Sanskrit
and Hindi, using the fast.ai framework. Building upon the approach of
Chinese-CLIP, we’ll develop models that understand the relationship
between images and text in Indic languages. The model will focus on
religious content and e-commerce domains.

## Developer Guide

This project uses [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) for development,
which allows creating Python libraries from Jupyter notebooks.

### Setup Development Environment

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `sh     git clone https://github.com/numb3r33/indic-clip.git # Replace with your repo URL if different     cd indic-clip`

2.  **Install dependencies:** It’s recommended to use a virtual
    environment (e.g., `conda` or `venv`).

    ``` sh
        # Using pip and venv
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Or using conda
    # conda create -n indic-clip python=3.9
    # conda activate indic-clip
    # pip install -r requirements.txt # Often easier than managing all via conda channels
    ```

3.  **Install the library in editable mode:** This links the installed
    package to your source code, so changes in notebooks are reflected
    after running `nbdev_prepare`. `sh     pip install -e .`

4.  **(Optional) Install Git hooks for nbdev:** This helps keep
    notebooks clean and synchronized. `sh     nbdev_install_hooks`

### Development Workflow

1.  **Make changes** in the Jupyter notebooks under the `nbs/`
    directory.
2.  **Export changes** from notebooks to the Python library
    (`indic_clip/`): `sh     nbdev_export`
3.  **Prepare the project** (cleans notebooks, runs tests, builds docs):
    `sh     nbdev_prepare`
4.  **Commit** your changes to Git.

## Usage (Placeholder)

Details on how to use the trained models and the library API will be
added here once implemented.
